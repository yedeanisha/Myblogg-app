It is a very popular drink from north India. It is very cooling and is an ideal drink for hot Indian summers. Apart from cooling properties jal jeera is also used as an appetizer because of its digestive properties.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode';font-size: 20px;">There are some other strong spices and herbs used in jal jeera along with cumin which makes it a tangy, sour, aromatic and spicy drink. They are mint, tamarind, fennel and black pepper. </p>

<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans';font-size:20px">Jal Jeera spices and herbs</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jeera or cumin seeds – peppery flavors & good for digestion.</li>
    <li>Saunf or fennel seeds – sweet and aromatic. Digestive and anti-oxidant.</li>
    <li>Black pepper – pungent and spicy. It has digestive properties and also adds a lot of punch to the drink.</li>
    <li>Black salt – digestive properties and also adds a lot of flavor. Often used in Shikanjvi – Indian lemonade and in Indian chaat snacks.</li>
    <li>Ginger – good for digestion. It is optional as it also produces heat. I have not used it</li>    
</ul>

    <li style="padding:8px 8px 8px 8px"> Rinse ⅓ cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves well with water. Drain all the water. Add the mint leaves in a small grinder jar. Only use the mint leaves. Do not add the stems as then the jal jeera can become bitter.</li>

    <li style="padding:8px 8px 8px 8px">Next add 1 teaspoon amchur powder (dry mango powder), 1 teaspoon chaat masala, 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) and black salt as required. If you do not have dry mango powder, then you can add some lemon juice. Instead of dry mango powder, kachri powder or bel powder can also be used. Instead of black salt, you can use rock salt or sea salt.</li>
    <li style="padding:8px 8px 8px 8px"> Grind to a smooth chutney. If you want you can even strain the chutney using a tea strainer.</li>

    <li style="padding:8px 8px 8px 8px">Take the jaljeera chutney in a bowl. Also add 1.5 cups water.</li>
    <li style="padding:8px 8px 8px 8px">Mix very well. Check the taste of jal jeera and add more salt and dry mango powder if required. You can also add some lemon juice if you want. if in case the jaljeera tastes bitter (due to the type and quality of mint leaves), then add some lemon juice to balance the bitterness. Keep it for a few hours in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li style="padding:8px 8px 8px 8px"> While serving you can add some boondi, a pinch of chaat masala and a few mint leaves in each glass. Boondi can be soaked in water for 20 to 30 minutes. Later squeeze the water and keep them aside. Add boondi while serving jaljeera.</li>
