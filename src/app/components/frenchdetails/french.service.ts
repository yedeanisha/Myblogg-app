"title":"Pain au Chocolate",
"step1":"Stir together yeast and ½ cup water heated to 115° together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook; let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in milk, sugar, 3 tbsp. melted butter, powdered milk, and salt; add flour. Mix on medium speed until a stiff dough forms, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a work surface and form into a thick square; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.",
"step2":"Place remaining butter on a sheet of plastic wrap; cover with another sheet. Using a rolling pin, pound and shape butter into a 6″, ½″-thick square; set aside. Using rolling pin, roll dough into an 16″ square on a lightly floured work surface. Unwrap butter square, and place on dough so its corners line up with the middle point of each side of dough square; fold dough corners over butter so they meet in the center. Roll dough into a 12″ x 9″ rectangle, and then tri-fold dough like a letter. Roll the dough into a 12″ x 9″ rectangle and repeat folding. Wrap in plastic wrap; chill for 30 minutes. Repeat rolling and folding dough twice more; chill for 1 hour.",
"step3" :"Roll dough into a 20″ x 14″ x ¼″ thick sheet; halve lengthwise. Cut each half into about 9 triangles, about 3 ½″-wide at their base; cut a ½″-deep slit in the middle of each wide base. Place 1 chocolate bar parallel to the base near the cut; holding the tip of the opposite corner down, roll the base over the chocolate toward the tip until it forms a tight roll. Place croissant on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, tip side down, and brush with egg wash. Repeat with remaining triangles, bars, and egg wash. Let croissants sit until doubled in size, about 2 ½–3 hours.",
"step4":"Heat oven to 375°. Working with one baking sheet at a time, brush croissants with more egg wash; bake until deep golden brown, about 20 minutes.",

      "title":"Basque Braised Chicken With Peppers",
      "step1":"Preheat the oven to 450°. Meanwhile, in an 8-quart Dutch oven or large, high-sided cast-iron skillet, warm 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer the sausages to a large plate, cut into 3-inch pieces, and set aside. Add the remaining oil to the pot and raise the heat to high. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper, then add skin side down to the pan",
      "step2":"Tuck the thyme sprigs, garlic, and bay leaf between the pieces. Cook until the skin is browned, 5-7 minutes. Transfer the chicken, thyme, garlic, and bay leaf to the plate with the sausages.",
      "step3" :"In the same pot over medium-high heat, add the onion and shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato and cook until the liquid evaporates, 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in 1⁄2 cup stock and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until the liquid is mostly evaporated, 5-8 minutes. Return the thyme, garlic, bay leaf, sausages, and chicken (skin side up) to the pot. Transfer to the oven and roast until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Move the chicken and sausages to a platter.",
      "step4":"Set the pot over medium-high heat. Add the wine, piquillo peppers, and remaining 1 cup stock and bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add back the chicken and sausages, and the potatoes if desired (or serve them on the side). Serve directly from the pot or on a platter, sprinkled with the apple, parsley, and piment d'Espelette.",

      "title":"Frozen Chocolate Mousse",
      "step1":"Make the marquise: Line an 8 1⁄2- to 9-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, smoothing the plastic against the sides of the pan as evenly as you can and leaving some overhang to help with the unmolding later.Fit a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Add the chocolate and butter to the bowl; heat, stirring, until just melted and velvety. (Do not overcook.) Remove the bowl and let it rest at room temperature 15 minutes.",
      "step2":"In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a large bowl with a handheld electric mixer, beat the yolks, cup sugar, and the salt on medium speed until the mixture lightens in color and thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.Add the yolk mixture to the melted chocolate mixture, and using a spatula, gently fold together. Transfer to a separate large bowl.",
      "step3" :"Spoon the crème fraîche mixture onto the chocolate and very gently fold it in to incorporate. Fold in the chopped cookies.Spoon the mousse into the prepared loaf pan, pushing it all the way into the corners and smoothing the top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze the marquise for at least 6 hours or up to 1 month.When ready to serve, make the ganache: In a medium heatproof bowl, add the chocolate. Bring the cream to a boil and pour half of it over the chocolate; let rest 30 seconds, then using a spatula, gently stir the chocolate and cream together in small circles. Pour in the rest of the cream, or more as needed, stirring until the ganache is smooth, shiny, and just thin enough to coat the marquise without running off completely.",
      "step4":"To remove the marquise, gently tug on the plastic wrap to release it from the pan and turn it out onto a cooling rack set atop a rimmed baking sheet. Cover with the ganache, coating evenly and letting any extra run off onto the baking sheet. Let set slightly, then transfer to the freezer if desired. The marquise is good frozen, but best when thawed slightly to be semifrozen or even defrosted. Serve sliced into about 1-inch-thick pieces (wet and wipe the knife before each cut) with a dollop of crème fraîche if desired.",

        "title":"Gougères (Cheese Puffs)",
        "step1":"Preheat your oven to 425°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.In a medium saucepan, heat the water, salt, and butter over medium heat until the mixture is smooth and the butter has melted. Then temporarily remove the pan from the heat and stir in the all-purpose flour. Stir the flour in until it's completely incorporated. Move the pan back to low heat and stir over the heat for a minute and a half, as the mixture pulls away from the sides and bottom of the saucepan.",
        "step2":"Let the pate a choux cool for about 5 minutes before adding in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each egg. Add the nutmeg and ground pepper, then stir. Follow with the cup of shredded cheese and mix until blended in well.",
        "step3" :"Grab a pastry bag with a 1 inch wide opening, or a freezer bag with the corner snipped to create a 1 inch wide opening, and fill with the pate a choux dough. Pipe out 1 inch wide mounds of the pate a choux onto your baking sheet. Allow about 1 and a half inches of room between each mound. Sprinkle some more shredded cheese on top of each mound.",
        "step4":"Bake the gougères for 10 minutes before lowering the oven temperature to 375F and baking for another 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're puffed up and a rich golden color. Do not open the oven until you're sure they're ready (at least until about the 15 minute mark, if your oven bakes pretty fast) or else they can deflate. Turn off the oven, then pierce each with the tip of a sharp knife to let out steam. Leave them in the oven once they’re done with the oven turned off and the door slightly open for another 15 minutes.",
